## Typography — optical sizing, tracking, leading

Apple designs type to change shape with size; the same discipline applies on the web. (From *The Details of UI Typography*, WWDC 2020.)

- **Tracking (letter-spacing) is size-specific — never one value for all sizes.** Large display text wants *negative* tracking (letters read too far apart as they grow); small text wants slightly *positive* tracking for legibility. A fixed `letter-spacing` is wrong somewhere. Tighten headings, leave body near `0`.
- **Leading (line-height) tracks size inversely.** Tight on large headings, looser on body copy. Increase it for scripts with tall ascenders/descenders; tighten it for dense, information-heavy UI.
- **Build hierarchy from weight + size + leading as a set,** not size alone. Emphasize with weight — it adds presence without taking more space.
- **Respect the user's text-size setting** (Dynamic Type). Scale layout *with* the text — spacing in `rem`/`em`, not fixed px — so a larger font doesn't break the layout.
- **Default to the platform's system font** before a custom face; it already ships optical sizing, tracking tables, and legibility tuning. Override only with a reason.

```css
:root { font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif; } /* body: system font, comfortable leading */

.display {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  line-height: 1.05;        /* tight leading for large text */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;  /* negative tracking as it grows */
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```
